# Sports-Analytics: NBA Salary and Player Stats Data 

This project aims to leverage business intelligence techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of NBA player statistics, team performance metrics, and social media engagement during the 2016-2017 season. I aim to extract valuable insights that can empower General Managers (GMs) of NBA teams in making strategic decisions for their team.


# Introduction
The objective of this project was to create a complete dashboard for NBA team managers and executive teams. These dashboards will provide insights into player performance, salary justification, fan engagement, team performance and other key metrics. The dashboard aimed to help with decision-making processes and strategic planning within the organization for better success of the team.

# Dashboard #1 Player Salary vs Age 

The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of NBA player salary caps for the 2017-2018 season, along with detailed player draft numbers linked to each player. The dashboard offers insights into team spending, player salaries, and the distribution of player ages within various positions. This report is found under the “Player Salary” section.

# Key Features
- The dashboard displays a summary of each NBA player’s total salary cap for the year 2017. This allows users to quickly compare spending across players and identify high-earned and low-earned players.
- The linked dataset provides detailed information about each player and their corresponding salaries for the year 2017-2018. Users can explore this data to understand which players contribute to the league in that season. We can identify any particularly high-earning players while reviewing their performance from the player and team performance dashboards in this project.
- The slicer report allows users to select a specific age range for NBA players. This functionality enables users to filter player data based on age.
- The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific teams or players for more detailed information. For example, clicking on a player name will reveal player salaries, or selecting a specific age range will dynamically update the displayed player data.

# Benefits of the Dashboard
- Comprehensive Salary Overview: Provides a clear summary of player salaries for the 2017-2018 season, aiding in quick comparison and analysis.
- In-Depth Player Analysis: Linked datasets offer detailed player information, helping users understand player contributions and identify high earners.

How to use: 

You can see an overview of players' salaries in a complex pie chart. You can begin to filter by adjusting age to your requirement and select a player of your choice to learn more about him. As you type the age, you can see the table drill down on players in that age group. You can select any player and learn what number they were drafted in the NBA and how much they are getting paid. You can understand why high drafted numbers get paid more as they are more skilled. You can select these players from the pie chart and also learn about their details that way. You can also see how age past 35 impacts a player's earnings by a lot as a player starts to perform badly.
