# Sports-Analytics: NBA Salaru and Player Stats Data 
This project aims to leverage business intelligence techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of NBA player statistics, team performance metrics, and social media engagement during the 2016-2017 season. I aim to extract valuable insights that can empower General Managers (GMs) of NBA teams in making strategic decisions for their team.
